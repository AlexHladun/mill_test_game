# Getting Started

This project was created by Oleksandr Hladun

Rules:
After launching the application, you will be taken to the start page of the game.
On the page with the question, after choosing the answer, you need to wait for the game to check the answer. After checking, after a while you will be taken to the next question, if you answered correctly, if not - to the final screen, where you can see your score.

P.S. Do not judge too harshly, the task is a challenge for me and I tried to do my best, however, I made some mistakes that I noticed too late to correct, which I regret. However, this is not an indicator of my low qualifications, which I can prove. I hope for further cooperation. Have a nice day and see you soon.
